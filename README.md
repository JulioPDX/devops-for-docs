# DevOps for Docs

Some simple text written in markdown. For example I can make a word **bold** or *italic*. Maybe I want to add a link to [arista.com](https://www.arista.com/en/). Maybe we want some inline `code`.

- some
- list
- random

1. some
2. random
3. list

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
